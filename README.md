## How to use

In your pubspec.yaml:
```yaml
dependencies:
  animated_background: ^1.0.1
```

```dart
import 'package:animated_background/animated_background.dart';
```

Use in a Stateful Widget with mixin `TickerProviderStateMixin` or pass a ticker provider in `vsync`.

```dart
AnimatedBackground(
  behaviour: RandomParticleBehaviour(),
  vsync: this,
  child: Text('Hello'),
);
```
